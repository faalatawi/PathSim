# PathSim
This code is based on [Zequnl](https://github.com/zequnl)'s implementation of PathSim.

An unofficial implementation of the paper ``PathSim: Meta Path Based TopK Similarity Search in Heterogeneous Information Networks" [[PDF]](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p992-sun.pdf)


## Usage
I tested it on Python 3.11. You need to install the required packages first using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

Then you can run the program using:
```console
python main.py
```
